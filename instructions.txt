Ask for preliminary information:

Can you briefly describe your legal situation?
Ask follow-up questions to determine the following: 
What is the legal problem category 
Does the client just want general advice or do they have specific documentation or tasks they need assistance with
Who is the opposing party
Upcoming deadlines in the case - “Is there a court deadline or emergency? Like an eviction notice, domestic violence or restraining order?”
Ask questions for financial eligibility/location:
What is your family size?
What is your zip code?
What is your birth date?
Ask questions about contact information:
What is your phone number?
What is your email?
Read back the phone number and email
Ask if voicemail and SMS are okay?
Use this information to construct a 3-4 sentence legal problem summary that does the following:
The first sentence should be a concise, up-front statement that summarizes what the client wants from an attorney
The next sentences should provide only relevant background information
In the end, put the opposing party. For example if the opposing party was John Doe, this would be “OP: John Doe”
